            <p class="lead"><font size = "4">Reading comprehension (RC) task, viewed as a type of questions-answering (QA) tasks, is perceived as the ideal method to evaluate language understanding by computer systems. Given a passage of text, a machine reading comprehension system is required to answer a set of questions over the given passage. We propose a shared task of Arabic Reading Comprehension over the Holy Qur’an, aiming to trigger state-of-the-art reading comprehension research on a book that is sacredly held by more than 1.8 billion people across the world. <br>
The Holy Qur’an is composed of 114 chapters (Suras) and 6,236 verses that comprise more than 80k words in Classical Arabic. The participating systems are expected to provide answers to questions on given passages (sets of consecutive verses) from the Holy Qur’an, where the answers are spans of text extracted from the given passages. Our dataset for the shared task (developed based on the AyaTEC dataset) is composed of 1,348 QA tuples of passage-question-answer triplets for 169 different questions. The dataset adopts the same format of the SQuAD v1.1 dataset. A question might have more than one answer in the passage; therefore, the system is expected to extract all of them and return a ranked list of answer spans. To evaluate the system performance, multiple evaluation measures, that adopt exact and partial matching of spans, will be used.
